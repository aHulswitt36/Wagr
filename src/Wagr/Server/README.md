# Server

### Description
This will be a REST API that connects to a postgres database. What will be stored in this database is just football league information (for now, more to come later) and the wagers that
the commissioner's will make for their league.  We will have to invite all the users from the league to join so that the wagers are valid.  The idea will be to be able to create 
dynamic Wagers for their league and those will become smart contracts that an Oracle will push data to.
